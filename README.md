# Tic Tac Toe

### A simple GraphQL implementation of a tic-tac-toe game

This is a GraphQL demo application of a tic-tac-toe game, implemented with Java, 
Spring Boot and the [Kickstart library](https://www.graphql-java-kickstart.com/). 

In the ```server``` folder there is the code of the server that exposes 
the APIs to play the game.

In the ```client``` folder there is a basic CLI client to test the server 
application and play the game.
